# BadgerTrustSystem+

## About

`BadgerTrustSystem+` is the most advanced trust system for the FiveM platform. Users can take control of their personal vehicles, peds, and/or weapons in-game that they purchased in the server's store. Give your users a better sense of security in which their personals cannot be used by others unless they give them permission. Use `BadgerTrustSystem+` :smile:
