# Introduction

Welcome to the section of documentation that features my publicly made software. Some of this software can be FiveM scripts that include a web panel integration such as BadgerTrustSystem. 

Some of these projects can also be a simple discord bot such as EssentialBot which has some nifty features like mute, kick, tempban, ban, sticky commands and even a fully fledged ticket system.

If you have any further questions and/or concerns about anything within this documentation, you may gather more support personally and from other members of the Badger Developer Community over [here](https://discord.gg/Rmzgwpn).
