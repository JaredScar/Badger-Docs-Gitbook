### What is it?

DiscordVehiclesRestrictions is a Discord based vehicle restriction script. I have previously made a script like this in the past, but it was made when I was barely considered a FiveM script developer. Due to the sloppy code practices within that script, I decided to rewrite the script and include something at most people had inquired about within the old one: Inheritance.

#### Old Script:

### Requirement

### Configuration

* It should be noted that for `Config.Inheritances`, the roleNames and roleIDs should match up with the ones specified in `Config.VehicleRestrictions`.
* Also, inheritance only inherits the role groups listed. Inheriting `RoleName2` which inherits `RoleName1` would not be inherited for `RoleName3`.

  \`\`\`lua Config = { RestrictedMessage = "~r~Restricted Vehicle Model.", InheritanceEnabled = false }

Config.VehicleRestrictions = { \['RoleName1 or ID'\] = { "baller", "baller2", "baller3", "baller4" }, \['RoleName2 or ID2'\] = {}, \['RoleName3 or ID3'\] = {}, \['RoleName4 or ID4'\] = {} }

-- Requires Config.InheritanceEnabled to be = true Config.Inheritances = { \['RoleName2 or ID'\] = {'RoleName1', 'RoleName3', 'RoleName4'}, \['RoleName3'\] = {'RoleName2'}, }

## Example Configuration
```lua
Config = {
    RestrictedMessage = "~r~Restricted Vehicle Model.",
    InheritanceEnabled = true
}

Config.VehicleRestrictions = {
    ['Head_Admin'] = {
        "baller",
        "baller2",
        "baller3",
        "baller4",
    },
    ['Admin'] = {
        "dcd",
        "chr20",
    },
    ['Moderator'] = {
        "nf6",
        "foxsnt",
        "foxshelby",
        "gt63s",
        "fhauler",
        "rescue1",
        "um1",
        "um2",
        "um3",
        "um4",
        "um5",
        "um6",
        "um6",
        "riot",
    },
}

-- Requires Config.InheritanceEnabled to be = true
Config.Inheritances = {
    ['Head_Admin'] = {'Admin', 'Moderator'},
}
```

Thanks to @clewis329 for helping to test this, a well as providing the example configuration file :\)
