# Introduction

Welcome to the section of documentation that features my FiveM discord-based scripts. These scripts have been known and referred to by some as the "backbone" to FiveM's game servers. These scripts make it possible to fully integrate things such as permissions, chat roles, and tags for a player all through the use of discord's role system.

It truly is a remarkable system and especially needed for servers growing in population quickly within the FiveM community. Many of these scripts were made for use with the server known as Prime Network which you can find over at [https://www.primenetwork.xyz](https://www.primenetwork.xyz/). Fun fact: The scripts are still used on there to this day! That must mean they are important!

If you have any further questions and/or concerns about anything within this documentation, you may gather more support personally and from other members of the Badger Developer Community over [here](https://discord.gg/Rmzgwpn).
