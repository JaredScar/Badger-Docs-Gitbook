**BadgerVoting**

This is a simple AOP voting script. Technically with the way it is designed, you could have it just be a voting script \(just change the messages\). Basically you can start AOP votes and have players actually vote for options to see what they want. It's quite simple, but the /aopvote command in another script I have never worked, so I put this one together.

### For all your hosting needs

#### Use code `BADGER15` at [https://iceline-hosting.com/billing/aff.php?aff=284](https://iceline-hosting.com/billing/aff.php?aff=284) for `15% off` your first month of any service \(excluding dedicated servers\)

`/startVote [seconds] [option1] [option2] [option3] [option4] [option5] - The amount of vote options you can have are unlimited. Basically every option is delimited by a space, so use "-" for things that usually require a space. (Example of what I mean is down in the Gifs below)`

`To use /startVote, add the ACE permission to the user group:`

```text
BadgerVoting.Commands.startVote
```

`/vote [id] - Vote for the specified ID of an option`
